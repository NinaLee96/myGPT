# myGPT

This tool has been developed as part of my exploration and learning journey with the LangChain library, and it serves as a practical implementation to test the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool was inspired by the many tools out there already such as `privateGPT` and `localGPT`. These tools offer a convenient way to enrich your local Large Language Model (LLM) with additional knowledge drawn from your own documents or selected URLs. This augmentation of the LLM allows you to pose queries that can now draw upon both the original LLM and the additional documents you provide.

# How it Works

myGPT works by ingesting the documents you provide (either local files or URLs) and converting them into a format that is digestible for the LLM. Each document is divided, or "chunked", into manageable sizes which are then processed by a GPT4ALL model to create embeddings. These embeddings are then stored on your local disk within the same directory from where they can be retrieved when running queries against the LLM.

I've tested the script with a variety of document types and sources, including a `.pdf` research paper, a random `.txt` file, a `.docx` report from college days, and a handful of URLs. Regardless of the source or format, myGPT can process these documents and make their content available for the LLM to use in its responses.

# System Requirements

myGPT was developed and tested on a MacOS M1 Pro with 16 GB RAM. The Large Language Model used for testing was the quantized Llama 2 7B or `llama2_7b_chat_uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_M.bin` available from Hugging Face.

# Supported Models

myGPT currently only supports:

GGML Models: These models are created to run inference (text completion) on CPUs or both CPUs and GPUs. The GGML format converts the floating point parameters of a model into integers, which results in less precise calculations but is sufficient for Large Language Models. There are different versions of GGML models, such as q3, q4, q5, q8, etc., where the numbers correspond to the bit precision of the model.

# Getting Started

Before you start using myGPT, ensure you have `libmagic` installed on your local machine as `UnstructuredURLLoader` depends on this library. Also, you will need to install a `GPT4ALL` or `LlamaCPP` compatible LLM that your hardware supports. You can find a variety of models at Hugging Face.

1. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Update the `LLM_PATH` to point to the location of your model path in the `.env` file:

   ```
   LLM_PATH="./models/<downloaded model name>"
   MODEL_N_CTX=1024
   MODEL_TYPE="LlamaCpp"
   CHUNK_SIZE=1000
   CHUNK_OVERLAP=10
   ```

3. Add files that you want to run queries against to the `/docs` directory.

4. Start the script

   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```

# Example outputs

It seems the LLM uses it's own acquired knowledge along with the paper that I wrote in college to come up with an answer to the question.

Enter a query: What can you tell me about Drug abuse and music connection?

> Entering new RetrievalQA chain...
> The connection between drugs and music has been around for many years, even before the rise of mainstream rock and hip-hop. Music has always played an important role in society, especially during times of rebellion and revolution. As with any form of art, music can reflect the emotions and experiences of its creator(s). Drugs have been a source of inspiration for many musicians, from Jimi Hendrix's "Drugs" to Pink Floyd’s “Hey You.” Some say that drugs enhance one's creative abilities while others argue that they hinder it. It is up to the individual artist and their interpretation of how drugs affect their music. Drug use has been a subject of many songs, from country (e.g., Merle Haggard’s “Mama Tried”) to rap (e.g., Eminem's "In Da Club"). These songs have become hits on the radio and in popular culture, reflecting society's acceptance of drug use. While there are many songs that glorify drugs, others speak out against it, such as Nirvana's “Smells Like Teen Spirit” or

> Drug abuse remain an issue in the world today due to the struggles many people may experience in their life. There are various mechanism or ways one can cope with their problems, but many turn to drugs and use it as an escape. They may develop into an addiction to the drug with careless-ness in the drugs they’re in-taking. Drug abuse is portrayed through music like Linkin Park’s “Breaking The Habit” and Macklemore’s “Starting Over” and only the individual themselves can end the addiction they have with the substances they’re using. Although both songs are from different genres, they both were able to express the struggle of drug abuse through music.

> ./docs/SocialCommentary.docx:
> Drug abuse is a common issue in the world. Many people often use drugs as an “escape” from their problems or as a coping mechanism because they may find it hard to deal with the issue that they face. In doing so, the individual may also become addicted to using drugs by taking the substances so frequently and using it as a coping mechanism. Statistics show that death from drug abuse has been steadily on the rise and is one of the leading causes of injury death in the United States. There are also various references of drug abuse through music from every genre as well. An example that magnifies this issue in music is the American rock band Linkin Park. This band illustrates the issue of drug abuse in their song “Breaking The Habit” from their album Meteora (2003). The song’s focus was on his addiction with drugs and his struggle with overcoming the use of drugs in which he refers to as “breaking the habit.” The upbeat sounds and vocals in the song together enhances and brings out the struggle of his drug addiction. Another song that focuses on this same issue is the hip-hop song “Starting Over” from the album The Heist (2012), by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. This song amplifies his struggle with drug addiction and abuse. In addition, he publicizes his relapse and raps about “starting over” again, in trying to be sober. The mellow beat and the chorus of the song sync together to draw out his emotions and disappointment of relapsing. Altogether drug abuse is a common issue globally and it is shown not just through statistics but also through music.
